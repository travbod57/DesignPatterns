     *
     * The Builder design pattern is a creational design pattern that lets us create an object one step at a time.
     * It is quite common to use this pattern when creating a complex object. By using this pattern, we can create different parts of an object, step by step,
     * and then connect all the parts together.
     *
     * Without this pattern, we can end up with a large constructor to provide all the required parameters for constructing our object.
     * That could lead to quite unreadable and hardly maintainable code. Furthermore, a constructor with lots of parameters has a downside to it.
     * We won’t need to use all the parameters, all the time.
     * 
     * The Director is only responsible for executing the building steps in a
     * particular sequence. It is helpful when producing products according to a
     * specific order or configuration. Strictly speaking, the Director class is
     * optional, since the client can control builders directly.
